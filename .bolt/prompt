Website Specification: Codost - Logical and Problem-Solving Practice Platform

1. Project Overview & Goals:

Website Name: Codost
Core Purpose: To provide a unique online platform for users to enhance their logical reasoning and problem-solving skills through a curated collection of coding questions that specifically avoid traditional Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.
Target Audience: Individuals looking to improve their analytical thinking, logical deduction, and problem-solving abilities. This could include:
Students learning to code or in fields requiring strong analytical skills.
Professionals in various domains seeking to sharpen their problem-solving aptitude.
Individuals interested in puzzles, logic games, and brain teasers but within a coding context.
Key Focus: Leveling up users' foundational logical and problem-solving skills, rather than preparing them for specific DSA-focused coding interviews.
Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Codost differentiates itself by explicitly excluding DSA questions and focusing on a distinct set of coding problems designed to foster broader logical thinking.
2. Website Functionality & Features:

2.1. Question Section:

Question Type:  Codost will feature a unique set of coding questions that are not DSA-based. These questions will emphasize:

Logical Deduction: Problems requiring users to analyze information, identify patterns, and deduce solutions based on given constraints and rules.
Mathematical Reasoning: Questions involving mathematical concepts, number theory, and quantitative problem-solving within a coding context.
Scenario-Based Logic: Problems presented as real-world scenarios or puzzles that require users to apply logical thinking to arrive at a coded solution.
Algorithmic Thinking (without DSA): Encouraging the development of step-by-step problem-solving approaches and algorithmic thinking, but without relying on standard data structures and algorithms like trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, etc., commonly found in DSA.
Examples of potential question themes (to further clarify to the developer):
Logic puzzles implemented in code (e.g., Sudoku solvers, logic grid puzzles).
Mathematical puzzles and games coded (e.g., Nim, number sequence problems).
Rule-based systems and simulations (e.g., implementing game rules, constraint satisfaction problems).
Problems requiring pattern recognition and sequence generation.
Questions focusing on efficient code writing without complex data structures (e.g., optimized loops, conditional logic, basic array/string manipulations).
Question Details Page: Each question page will include:

Clear Question Description: A concise and unambiguous explanation of the problem to be solved.
"Applications" or "Why This Question Type Matters" Section:
Explanation of the underlying logical principles being tested by the question.
Real-world applications of the type of logical thinking and problem-solving skills required for the question. This section will highlight the broader relevance of these skills beyond just coding, such as in decision-making, analysis, and everyday problem-solving. For example:
For a logic puzzle question: "These types of problems help in developing deductive reasoning, crucial for debugging complex systems or analyzing data."
For a mathematical reasoning question: "Mathematical thinking is fundamental in computer science and many other fields. This problem type improves your quantitative analysis skills."
Interactive Coding Environment (Code Editor): A user-friendly code editor directly on the webpage where users can write and test their code.
Test Cases: Pre-defined test cases that users can run against their code to verify its correctness. Potentially with:
Basic Test Cases (Visible): Initial, simpler test cases to guide users.
Hidden Test Cases (For Final Submission): More comprehensive and edge-case test cases to ensure robust solutions.
"Hint" System (Optional, but good to consider): A progressive hint system that offers guidance without giving away the solution directly. Hints could be revealed step-by-step if the user is stuck.
"Solution" Section (Available after attempt or submission - configurable): A well-explained solution to the question, showcasing an efficient and logical approach. This should not just be code but also explain the thought process behind it.
Discussion Forum (Optional but highly beneficial): A section for users to discuss the question, their approaches, and ask for help from the community and potentially moderators/website owners.
2.2. User Dashboard:

Personalized Overview: Upon logging in, the user dashboard should provide a quick overview of their activity and progress.
Key Dashboard Elements:
User Profile Summary: Display username, join date, and potentially a profile picture (if user profile customization is desired).
Progress Tracking:
Questions Attempted: Number of questions the user has started.
Questions Solved/Completed: Number of questions the user has successfully solved (passed all test cases).
Accuracy Rate (Optional): Percentage of questions solved correctly out of those attempted.
Recently Viewed Problems: A list of the most recent questions the user has accessed or attempted, for easy navigation back to them.
Bookmarked/Saved Questions (Optional but highly valuable): A feature for users to save questions they want to revisit or work on later.
Performance Charts/Graphs (Optional but enhances user engagement): Visual representations of their progress over time, potentially showing questions solved per week, accuracy trends, etc.
Achievements/Badges (Optional - Gamification element): Consider incorporating a system of achievements or badges for completing sets of questions, reaching milestones, or demonstrating consistent performance. This can increase user motivation.
3. Technical Considerations (For the Full-Stack Developer - to be further discussed and specified):

Technology Stack (To be decided - examples):
Frontend: React, Vue.js, or similar JavaScript framework for a dynamic and interactive user interface. HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, or similar for server-side logic and API development.
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or similar for storing user data, questions, solutions, and website content.
Code Editor Integration: Need to integrate a suitable online code editor component (e.g., CodeMirror, Monaco Editor) that supports syntax highlighting, code execution (likely server-side execution for security and resource management), and test case integration.
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure user registration, login, and session management.
Responsiveness: The website should be fully responsive and accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
Scalability: Consider potential future growth and design the architecture to be scalable to handle increasing numbers of users and questions.
Performance: Website should be fast and efficient, with quick loading times for question pages and code execution.
Security: Implement security best practices to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
4.  Design and User Experience (UX) Considerations:

Clean and Intuitive Design: The website should have a clean, uncluttered, and easy-to-navigate design. Focus on readability and a positive user experience.
Engaging and Motivating Interface: Consider using design elements and features that encourage users to practice regularly and stay engaged (e.g., progress visualization, optional gamification).
Clear Information Architecture: Information should be well-organized and easy to find. Questions should be categorized or tagged appropriately (even if the categories are implicit based on problem type).
Mobile-First Approach (Recommended) or at least Responsive Design: Ensure a good user experience on mobile devices.
5.  Future Features (Optional - for roadmap consideration):

Question Difficulty Levels: Implement a system to categorize questions by difficulty (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
Categorization/Tagging of Questions: Allow users to filter or search for questions based on specific logic types or themes.
Personalized Question Recommendations: Based on user performance, recommend questions of appropriate difficulty or type.
Contests/Challenges: Introduce timed coding contests or themed challenges to add a competitive element.
User Profiles and Community Features: Expand user profiles, add social features like following other users, leaderboards (if desired).
More Detailed Analytics: Provide users with more granular insights into their performance, strengths, and weaknesses.
